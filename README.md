# Multithreading
A multithreaded program that calculates various statistical values for a list 
of numbers. This program will be passed a series of numbers on the command line and 
will then create three separate worker threads. One thread will determine the average 
of the numbers, the second will determine the maximum value, and the third will 
determine the minimum value. For example, suppose you pass the following 
integers: 90 81 78 95 79 72 85
The program will report:
The average value is 82
The minimum value is 72
The maximum value is 95
